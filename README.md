This report presents the findings from the thorough data cleaning and analysis of a town’s 
mock census data. The objective was to inform the local government on the best use of an 
unoccupied plot of land and the allocation of resources and investment based on insights 
gleaned from the analysis. Key findings included a median age of 34, an increasing 
demand for high-density housing driven by a 27.4% marriage rate and 11.4% 
immigration rate, a youthful population, and an employment rate of 53.19% percent. 
Additionally, investment in schooling and general infrastructure was recommended to 
accommodate the town’s growing population and ensure sustainable development.
